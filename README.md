# Would You Rather... Project

This is my version of the final assessment project for Udacity's React/Redux Fundamentals course.

This version includes the core Udacity requirements. I created my own css files to fit as much as possible the style of the demo app (always a nice css exercice to start from scratch and without any css framework) and I expect to add the following functionalities in the coming months:

- unit tests,
- ability to create new users,
- add authentication using AWS tools,
- create the backend using AWS Lambda.

## TL;DR

To see it running on aws, go [here](http://reactnd-would-you-rather.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)

To run this project locally and/or improve it:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
